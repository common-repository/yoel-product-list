create a responsive product catalog easily 

== Description ==
i created this plugin custom made for a specific project. now i release it for free.

its easy to use,customize, and uses bootstrap so its also mobile friendly

how it works:

this plugin was made to showcase a list of products, with a title and an image (using bootstrap framework).
when a user clicks an image a lightbox will open, it will have a title, big picture and description.
below the description there will be more pictures of the product with a list,once a small img is clicked,
it will replace the big img inside the lightbox.

how to use:
i made a how to use page in the yoel products menu ,it has example shortcodes.
other then that the forms for the products are straight foreword and was mae for easy
use and editing.

for developers:
you can change how it looks with youre own css class or by changing the plugins css.
you can also edit the jqury code.
both js and css files are short and easy to understand.

if you want to see my other plugins write yoel in the plugins search form.
